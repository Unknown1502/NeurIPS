# Kaggle Notebook - Professional Configuration

## Overview

The ARC_AGI_Competition_Notebook.ipynb has been updated for professional use on Kaggle with the dataset included in the GitHub repository.

## Key Changes Made

### 1. Removed All Emojis
- Professional formatting throughout
- Clear, concise headers
- No decorative icons

### 2. Updated Path Configuration
All paths now point to the cloned GitHub repository which includes the dataset:

| Component | Local Path | Kaggle Path |
|-----------|------------|-------------|
| Repository | `c:\Users\prajw\OneDrive\Desktop\google golf` | `/kaggle/working/NeurIPS-2025` |
| Data | `./data` | `/kaggle/working/NeurIPS-2025/data` |
| Solutions | `./solutions` | `/kaggle/working/solutions` |

### 3. Dataset Location
**Important:** The dataset is included in your GitHub repository at `Unknown1502/NeurIPS-2025`, so you do NOT need to add a separate Kaggle dataset.

## Kaggle Setup Instructions

### Step 1: Create Kaggle Notebook
1. Go to Kaggle.com
2. Click "Create" â†’ "New Notebook"
3. Upload `ARC_AGI_Competition_Notebook.ipynb`

### Step 2: Clone Repository (Cell 2)
In the second cell of the notebook, uncomment this line:
```python
!git clone https://github.com/Unknown1502/NeurIPS-2025.git /kaggle/working/NeurIPS-2025
```

Run the cell to clone your repository (includes code + dataset).

### Step 3: Run Setup (Cell 3)
The setup cell is already configured with Kaggle paths:
```python
repo_path = '/kaggle/working/NeurIPS-2025'
DATA_DIR = "/kaggle/working/NeurIPS-2025/data"
SOLUTIONS_DIR = "/kaggle/working/solutions"
```

Just run the cell - no changes needed.

### Step 4: Verify Dataset (Cell 4)
Run the verification cell to confirm:
- Repository cloned successfully
- Dataset files are accessible
- Task files are correctly formatted

### Step 5: Initialize Solver (Cell 5)
Run to initialize the ARC solver framework with the cloned dataset.

### Step 6: Start Solving
Proceed with the workflow cells to analyze and solve tasks.

## Local Setup Instructions

To use the notebook locally, update Cell 3 with these paths:

```python
repo_path = r'c:\Users\prajw\OneDrive\Desktop\google golf'
DATA_DIR = "./data"
SOLUTIONS_DIR = "./solutions"
```

Then skip Cell 2 (the git clone cell).

## Notebook Structure

### Setup Cells (1-5)
- Cell 1: Kaggle setup header
- Cell 2: Git clone command
- Cell 3: Path configuration reference
- Cell 4: Competition overview
- Cell 5: Setup and imports
- Cell 6: Dataset verification
- Cell 7: Solver initialization

### Workflow Cells (6-25)
- Load and explore tasks
- Pattern detection
- Solution development
- Testing
- Code golf optimization
- Batch processing
- Progress tracking
- Submission generation

## Verification Checklist

Before solving tasks, verify:

- [ ] Cell 2: Repository cloned successfully
- [ ] Cell 5: No import errors
- [ ] Cell 6: Dataset files found (400 tasks)
- [ ] Cell 7: Solver initialized successfully
- [ ] Cell 10: Can load and analyze task 1

## Path Configuration Summary

### Kaggle Configuration (Default)
```python
repo_path = '/kaggle/working/NeurIPS-2025'
DATA_DIR = "/kaggle/working/NeurIPS-2025/data"
SOLUTIONS_DIR = "/kaggle/working/solutions"
```

### Local Configuration
```python
repo_path = r'c:\Users\prajw\OneDrive\Desktop\google golf'
DATA_DIR = "./data"
SOLUTIONS_DIR = "./solutions"
```

## Important Notes

1. **No Separate Dataset Required**: The dataset is in your GitHub repo, so you don't need to add a Kaggle dataset.

2. **GitHub Repository Must Be Public**: Ensure `Unknown1502/NeurIPS-2025` is public or accessible from Kaggle.

3. **Writable Directory**: On Kaggle, only `/kaggle/working/` is writable. This is why we clone to `/kaggle/working/NeurIPS-2025`.

4. **Dataset Size**: Your GitHub repo includes 400 task files with train, test, and arc-gen examples. Make sure all files are committed and pushed.

## Troubleshooting

### "Repository not found" when cloning
**Solution:** Verify the repository is public and the URL is correct.

### "No module named 'arc_solver'"
**Solution:** 
- Verify clone completed successfully
- Check `repo_path` is set to `/kaggle/working/NeurIPS-2025`
- Run `!ls /kaggle/working/NeurIPS-2025` to verify files exist

### "No task files found"
**Solution:**
- Verify DATA_DIR points to `/kaggle/working/NeurIPS-2025/data`
- Check that `data/` folder with task*.json files is in your GitHub repo
- Run Cell 6 to see what files exist

### Import errors
**Solution:**
- Make sure all files (arc_solver.py, utils/) are in the GitHub repo
- Verify sys.path.insert(0, repo_path) executed successfully

## Testing on Kaggle

After setup, run this in a new cell to verify everything:

```python
# Quick verification test
import os
print("Repository exists:", os.path.exists('/kaggle/working/NeurIPS-2025'))
print("Data exists:", os.path.exists('/kaggle/working/NeurIPS-2025/data'))
print("Task files:", len(list(Path('/kaggle/working/NeurIPS-2025/data').glob('task*.json'))))

from arc_solver import ARCTaskSolver
solver = ARCTaskSolver(
    data_dir='/kaggle/working/NeurIPS-2025/data',
    solutions_dir='/kaggle/working/solutions'
)
print("Solver initialized successfully!")
```

## GitHub Repository Checklist

Before using on Kaggle, ensure your GitHub repo includes:

- [ ] `arc_solver.py`
- [ ] `utils/` directory with all utility modules
- [ ] `data/` directory with all 400 task*.json files
- [ ] `examples/` directory (optional but helpful)
- [ ] `README.md` (optional but helpful)
- [ ] Repository is public or accessible

## Summary

The notebook is now configured for professional use on Kaggle:

- No emojis or decorative elements
- Clean, professional formatting
- Dataset included in GitHub repository
- Simple clone-and-run setup
- Clear path configuration
- Comprehensive verification steps

Just clone the repository and start solving tasks!
